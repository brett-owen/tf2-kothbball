=============

**tf2-kothbball** is a SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2, enabling a king of the hill style gameplay mode for Team Fortress 2 Basketball.

In-game, use `!add` in chat to join the game, `!remove` in chat to return to spectator. Using `!mystatus` in chat will show your current status as well.
Players can use `!streaks` to show the top win streaks for the server.

Admins can use `!punt <PLAYERID>` to remove players from the queue or the game.
Admins can use `!resetstreaks` to reset the top win streaks for the server.

Note that this plugin **requires** the [TF2 Respawn System by WoZeR](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=611953) plugin in order to properly set the respawn times to 2 seconds.
